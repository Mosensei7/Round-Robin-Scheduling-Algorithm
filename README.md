# Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm
Shows the simulation of process scheduling using round robin algorithm.
Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.

A Gantt Chart is displayed which shows the state of every process (ready, run, terminate) at every time interval along with burst time, turn around time and waiting time.
